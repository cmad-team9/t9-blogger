						<p id ="post1Content">
							We are a group of friends who love trekking. All kinds – jungle trails, hillocks, moderate rock climbing.
							And it had been quite sometime since we last did something like that. The last few months had been pretty 
							hectic for all of us, workwise. We hadn’t got a chance to go out anywhere to refresh our minds!
							One morning, a friend forwarded a mail which had these beautiful snaps of the Doodhsagar Falls.

							off running buses and last minute exam preparations...
